            The general topic of our project is wanting to sublet and sublease housing in Seattle, with the focus generally being on University of Washington students. The main information technology problem in the space of subletting and subleasing is the overall lack of accessibility and a lack of a central platform in order to do so, and the majority of the time the tenants will have to negotiate these deals one-on-one with those interested, which is an inefficient process overall. Airbnb has tried to address the subletting space by offering <a target="_blank" href="https://www.airbnb.com/sublets">monthly rentals</a>, which works like a regular Airbnb stay but with longer-term rentals rather than staying for just a week or so, where users can have conversations with the tenants and leave reviews for other users to see. While this can succeed in certain cases, their greatest focus is on short-term rentals and will not fully be dedicated to the nuances of this aspect of housing, especially if this web app is concentrating on specifically University of Washington students and residents of the general Seattle region. This web app can also help with the problem of a lack of a positive relationship between the tenant and future residents, as the tenant can truly feel that their place is being left in the right hands with our solution.

        <p>
            Users can fill out a form that will ask them their name, year, major, housing location, housing price, housing distance from campus, term availability, and other information relevant to subletting. Most importantly, it will include contact information for other users to reach out to. This form will be uploaded as a post to the WebApp. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can filter posts by housing price, distance, accessibility, and other factors to determine what housing they want for the rest of the quarter. Then they can click on the housing which will take them to an external link (the housing website, if applicable) and the contact information of the person. There will be no user interaction on the website itself to protect users from spam/trolling.
            Users can log in to edit their post on the website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Users will be viewing information in the form of images and text that represent the various apartments they will be able to choose between. The images will display information to the users regarding a potential apartment they will be leasing. The text alongside these images will give users more information about the apartment including pricing, location, amenities, how to contact the current tenant of the apartment, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This app will help solve the problem by providing users with a centralized website where they can browse apartments that are available for subletting. As of right now, students are able to find apartments to sublet using platforms like Airbnb, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, or just through word of mouth. While these options are viable, it is often hard to find apartments that are close enough to campus and support the needs of students (as opposed to other kinds of tenants). This app is specially designed for use by UW students, and will be designed keeping their specific needs in mind.
